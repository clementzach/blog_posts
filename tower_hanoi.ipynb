    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A team of researchers recently [published a paper](https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf) claiming that large reasoning models (LRMs) are not capable of \"thinking\" or making logical choices using some simple logical puzzles. In the paper, LLMs (Large Language Models) and LRMs are both capable of solving the puzzles when low-complexity versions of the puzzles are presented, but when high-complexity versions are presented, both LRMs and LLMs are incapable of logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll be referring to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, one of the puzzles used in the paper. The rules and an explanation of the game can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll attempt to modify the experiment design to account for two possible flaws in the paper's methodology: \n",
    "1. Perhaps the language models were failing simply because the context is too small\n",
    "2. Perhaps the language models were failing because they did not have a way to update and understand the \"current state\" of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had some personal experience with the second potential flaw when, in an attempt to prove that I am smarter than a machine, I tried to write out all of the moves necessary to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 9 rings. I ended up spending a lot of time trying to go back through moves and remember what the \"current state\" was. However, when I solved the puzzle in a way that I could always see the \"current state\", I was a lot faster. \n",

      "    There are three pegs and 9 disks of different sizes stacked on the first peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to n (largest). Disk moves in this puzzle should follow:\n",
      "    1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",

      "    The goal is to move the entire stack to the third peg.\n",

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a fun way to do a modest replication/extension the paper on language model reasoning. \n",
    "1. This replication reduces my confidence in LLMs and LRMs ability to \"reason\" through problems more than the original paper did. If LLMs and LRMs are not able to reliably choose the next step to solve the Tower of Hanoi when the current state is presented to them, I am not confident that there is any logic/reasoning happening. \n",
    "2. From my limited experience, it does seem that LRMs have a better ability to \"reason\" than LLMs do. Perhaps a stronger reasoning model would have more \"reasoning\" ability than the one I used and be more able to solve the puzzle when prompted in this fashion\n",
    "3. LLMs seem to be better at giving solutions to models all at once, rather than looking at the current state of the problem and making incremental fixes. This does seem to be a fundamental weakness in LLMs, as a lot of real-world work that happens takes place in incremental fashions, where you are not exactly at the start state or end state of a problem.\n",
    "4. It seems that restricting context available to a reasoning model helps it to improve reasoning performance and avoid repeating poor moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It would be interesting to do more trials and explore more quantitatively how LLMs and LRMs compare, and how the context provided influences performance. \n",
    "2. It would be interesting to see how this would perform on a better reasoning model than o4-mini. If any of you are curious and want to extend this work with a a better reasoning model, I would be interested to hear about it!\n",
    "3. It might be interesting to extend the length of the context for the models that are provided with the limited context window (i.e. give them 5 previous context states). \n",
    "4. It would be interesting to see if a voting system with multiple agents would be more likely to return the correct answer. \n",
    "5. The system prompt could probably be improved to improve model responsiveness. \n",
