    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A team of researchers recently [published a paper](https://ml-site.cdn-apple.com/papers/the-illusion-of-thinking.pdf) claiming that large reasoning models (LRMs) are not capable of \"thinking\" or making logical choices using some simple logical puzzles. In the paper, LLMs (Large Language Models) and LRMs are both capable of solving the puzzles when low-complexity versions of the puzzles are presented, but when high-complexity versions are presented, both LRMs and LLMs are incapable of logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll be referring to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, one of the puzzles used in the paper. The rules and an explanation of the game can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'll attempt to modify the experiment design to account for two possible flaws in the paper's methodology: \n",
    "1. Perhaps the language models were failing simply because the context is too small\n",
    "2. Perhaps the language models were failing because they did not have a way to update and understand the \"current state\" of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had some personal experience with the second potential flaw when, in an attempt to prove that I am smarter than a machine, I tried to write out all of the moves necessary to solve the Tower of Hanoi with 9 rings. I ended up spending a lot of time trying to go back through moves and remember what the \"current state\" was. However, when I solved the puzzle in a way that I could always see the \"current state\", I was a lot faster. \n",

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a fun way to replicate and extend the paper on language model reasoning. \n",
    "1. This replication reduces my confidence in LLM's ability to reason through problems more than the original paper did. If LLMs are not able to reliably choose the next step to solve the Tower of Hanoi when the current state is presented to them, I am not confident that there is any logic/reasoning happening. \n",
    "2. Models perform better at puzzles with many instances of the previous state in their context than with just 2 previous state instances. \n",
    "3. LLMs seem to be better at giving solutions to models all at once, rather than looking at the current state of the problem and making incremental fixes. This does seem to be a fundamental weakness in LLMs, as a lot of real-world work that happens takes place in incremental fashions, where you are not exactly at the start state or end state of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If I had more money to burn on openAI credits, I would have tried this with one of OpenAI's reasoning models instead of gpt-4.1. If any of you are curious and want to extend this work with a a reasoning model, I would be interested to hear about it!\n",
    "2. It might be interesting to extend the length of the context for the models that are provided with the limited context window and increase the number of discs in the tower. I did not do this because performance was already bad with 3 discs, but if you try this, let me know about it.\n",
    "3. The system prompt could probably be improved to improve model responsiveness. \n",
