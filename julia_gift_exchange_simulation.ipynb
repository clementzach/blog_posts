    "### Simulation study\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation studies are used in statistics to estimate the probability of a certain event happening using pseudorandom numbers generated by a computer. Because it can be expensive and time-consuming to collect lots of real-world data on a phenomenon, statisticians sometimes use computers to create many simulated worlds and determine the frequency of an event happening in those simulated worlds. Simulation studies are used when it is difficult or impossible to analytically compute the probability of an event happening. For example, simulation is generally used to model processes happening on complex networks. \n",

    "One of my favorite family traditions is our sibling gift draw: we each draw from a hat to choose a sibling to give a gift to. Then, on christmas, we all open gifts from each other one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "My youngest sibling will usually open the first gift. Then, whoever gave the youngest sibling the gift opens their gift, and so on. This cycle of opening gifts continues until either we have all opened our gifts, or until someone opens a gift which was given to them by the youngest sibling. If this happens, we have to choose another person to open a gift, and start another cycle of gift-opening. \n",
    "\n",
    "This year, something unusual happened: there were 4 \"cycles\" of gift-giving—the maximum number possible. Six of us had reciprocal gift assignments (they received a gift from the same person that they gave a gift to). This seemed unusual to me, but I wanted to know how unusual this event was. So, I set out to do a simulation study to assess how likely this was. "
